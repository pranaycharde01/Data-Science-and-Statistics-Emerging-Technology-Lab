# 📘 Data Science & Machine Learning Practicals

Welcome to the *Data Science and Statistics Lab!* 👋
This repository is designed to help you *learn data science step by step* through simple and fun *hands-on practicals* using *Python* and *Jupyter Notebooks*.

---

## 🌟 About This Repository

This lab includes a collection of *notebooks* that cover everything from *data cleaning* to *machine learning algorithms*.
Each practical focuses on one concept and includes examples, exercises, and visualizations to make learning easier.

You’ll get to:

* Understand how data science works in real life
* Practice using important Python libraries
* Learn by doing — not just reading! 💪

2. 📏 *Central Tendency* – Mean, Median, Mode made simple
3. 🧮 *DataFrame Basics* – Create, edit, and merge data tables
4. 🧹 *Missing Data* – Handle empty or null values
5. 🔢 *NumPy Arrays* – Create and process numerical data
6. 📊 *Visualization* – Plot beautiful graphs and charts
7. 📈 *Linear Regression* – Predict values from data
8. ⚡ *Logistic Regression* – Classify data into groups
9. 👥 *KNN Algorithm* – Find patterns from nearby examples
10. 🌲 *Decision Tree* – Build tree-based models
11. 🌳 *Random Forest* – Improve predictions with multiple trees
12. 💫 *SVM* – Separate data with hyperplanes
